# Context-Aware Content Recommendation System

## 📌 Overview
This project implements a **Context-Aware Content Recommendation System** using **modern Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques.  
The system recommends movies based on **semantic similarity** of content and adapts recommendations according to **user context** such as mood and available time.

Unlike traditional keyword-based or rating-based systems, this project uses **sentence embeddings** to capture deeper semantic meaning, making the recommendations more accurate and relevant.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
With the rapid growth of digital platforms, users are exposed to an overwhelming amount of content. Traditional recommendation systems often ignore situational context such as user mood or time constraints.

This project aims to design a recommendation system that:
- Understands content at a semantic level
- Provides personalized recommendations
- Adapts suggestions based on user context

## 🚀 Key Features
- Content-based recommendation approach
- Uses **Sentence Embeddings (Transformer-based NLP)**
- Context-aware filtering (mood & time)
- Memory-efficient on-demand similarity computation
- Fully explainable and ethical AI design
- Uses a real-world benchmark dataset (MovieLens)

## 🧠 Approach & System Design
1. **Data Preparation**
   - Clean and preprocess movie titles, genres, and tags
   - Combine metadata into a unified content representation

2. **Semantic Representation**
   - Convert content into dense vectors using a pretrained sentence embedding model

3. **Similarity Computation**
   - Compute cosine similarity on-demand for scalability

4. **Context-Aware Filtering**
   - Refine recommendations based on user mood and available time

5. **Final Recommendation**
   - Return top-N relevant movies satisfying both similarity and context
